## What is it?

VPDB is an open platform where people can share their digital recreations of virtual pinball tables and everything else 
around virtual pinball. This is the server part of the platform, a.k.a the API. If you're looking for the web application,
it's [here](https://github.com/vpdb/website). 

## Stack

VPDB runs on a [Node.js](http://nodejs.org/) stack written in [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/). The web 
framework is [koa](https://koajs.com/). Data comes from [MongoDB](https://www.mongodb.org/) and queues and caches are 
handled by [Redis](http://redis.io/).

## "Quick" Install

* Download and install [GraphicsMagick](http://www.graphicsmagick.org/), [pngquant](http://pngquant.org/),
  [OptiPNG](http://optipng.sourceforge.net/), [FFmpeg](https://www.ffmpeg.org/) and [Unrar](http://rarsoft.com/) and 
  make sure that the binaries are in your `PATH`.
* Install [MongoDB](http://www.mongodb.org/downloads) and [Redis](http://redis.io/). *Windows*: Get binary 
  [here](https://github.com/MSOpenTech/redis/tree/2.8/bin/release), extract it to somewhere, open an admin shell and 
  run `redis-server --service-install redis.windows.conf --loglevel verbose --maxheap 500m` for a local dev setup.

Install Node.js 8+ and Git, then open a command line and type:

	git clone https://github.com/vpdb/server.git vpdb-server
	cd vpdb-server
	npm install
	npm run serve:dev

That's it, the API should now be available. Retrieve tags:

	curl http://localhost:3000/api/v1/tags

For more detailed instructions, check out the [Installation Guide](INSTALL.md).

### Tests

There are 1000+ automated integration tests. It's best to use two terminals to run them:

- `npm run test:serve` - Runs the server in test mode
- `npm run test:run` - Runs the tests

For more info, see [tests](TESTS.md).

### Code Quality

When running the server in development or test mode, the code is linted using [JSHint](http://www.jshint.com/about/). If
the code doesn't pass, tests fail. You can run the linting manually with the `jshint` task.

There's also continuous integration running on three services:

|           | Status                                                   |
|-----------|----------------------------------------------------------|
| Travis CI | [![Build Status Travis CI][travis-image]][travis-url]    |
| Codeship  | [![Build Status Codeship][codeship-image]][codeship-url] |

After every test run, code coverage stats are sent to [Coveralls.io](https://coveralls.io/r/vpdb/backend). Note that 
both CI and code coverage only concern server-side code.

Code is also run through Code Climate, with the following result: [![Code Climate][codeclimate-image]][codeclimate-url]
